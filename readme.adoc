= BlueUnixBridges

This repository provides a set of utilities to enable bluespec simulators to expose some of their I/O ports to their host systems via unix fifo or sockets (currently only fifos).
It also provides some utility functions to enable writing host tools to communicate with simulators.
See the https://github.com/gameboo/BlueUnixFifo/tree/main/examples[examples] for more details.

= APIs

The BlueUnixBridges library provides a set of C and BSV functions. The C
functions are prefixed by the initials of each word in the library name, `bub`,
followed by one of `_fifo_` or `_socket_`, and then followed by the actual
function name.

== Unix fifos API

=== "Simulator" Bluespec SystemVerilog API

```bsv
module mkUnixFifoSource #(String pathname) (Source #(t));
```
```bsv
module mkUnixFifoSink #(String pathname) (Sink #(t))
```

=== "Host" C API

```c
fifo_desc_t* bub_fifo_OpenAsProducer (char* pathname, size_t bytesize, encoder_t encoder);
```
```c
fifo_desc_t* bub_fifo_OpenAsConsumer (char* pathname, size_t bytesize, decoder_t decoder);
```
```c
fifo_desc_t* bub_fifo_OpenAsProducerConsumer (char* pathname, size_t bytesize, encoder_t encoder, decoder_t decoder);
```
```c
bool bub_fifo_Consume (fifo_desc_t* desc, void* elemdest);
```
```c
bool bub_fifo_Produce (fifo_desc_t* desc, void* elemsrc);
```
```c
void bub_fifo_Close (fifo_desc_t* desc);
```

== Future work
=== Socket bridges
Currently, the available BlueUnixBridges are backed by Unix FIFOs. An additional future implementation of the same BSV API could be backed by Unix sockets. This would enable communication with other Unix processes (either conventional software or other BSV simulators) over the network.
=== Termination helper primitive
It is currently left up to the user how to clean up Unix FIFOs after process termination. We would like to provide some helper functions that can be called by the user to streamline termination clean up.
=== More documentation
With a richer set of functionality, we would like to provide a high level presentation and some code examples to make this library easier to use.
